    <p>
    openSNP is a community-driven and community-owned project which lives
    through the contributions of its members. It is not associated with any
    institution and the only funding source for
    openSNP <a href="https://www.patreon.com/openSNP">is continuous crowdfunding,
      which pays for the hosting costs</a>.

    <h4>Who's running the openSNP.org infrastructure?</h4>
    <p>
    The bulk of the coding was done by
    <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gedankenstuecke">Bastian Greshake</a>,
    <a href="http://twitter.com/helgerausch">Helge Rausch</a> and
    <a href="http://twitter.com/PhilippBayer">Philipp Bayer</a>,
    who are also taking care of running and maintaining the live website.
    </p>
    <p>
    Bastian is working on his PhD in bioinformatics at the University of Frankfurt,
    while Philipp already successfully took that step and is now a bioinformatics
    post-doc at the University of Western Australia in Perth. Helge is working and
    living as a webdesigner in Berlin and probably the biggest reason why this
    website still works.
