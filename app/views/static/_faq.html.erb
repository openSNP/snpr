The data will then be openly available for the world to see and download. We also parse these SNPs and annotate them.</p><p>For annotation we include the manually curated <a href="http://www.snpedia.com">SNPedia</a> and find Open Access primary publications which appear in the journals of <a href="http://www.plos.org">The Public Library of Science</a> (PLoS), a Open Access publishing group. Additionally we screen <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, a crowd-sourced repository of scientific publications.</p><p>You can also publish some of your phenotypes so some day it might get possible to associate some SNPs with phenotypes (because of this we really would like to encourage you to do so, helping science generates this warm, fuzzy feeling inside of you).</p><p>And of course you can also share your knowledge about SNPs and phenotypes with other users and can socialize.</p>

Bastian and Philipp did their undergraduate studies in Life Sciences and are currently doing their master-programmes. Bastian currently studies Ecology & Evolution and Philipp is a PhD-candidate in bioinformatics. Helge is the only “real” web developer on the team and has helped us a lot in testing much of the things we did. We have one former member: <a href="https://plus.google.com/108875984450420228123/posts">Fabian</a>, who studies Biology. We are not working full time on this project, this is more of a hobby.

           <em>openSNP</em> is a non-profit, <a href="https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/snpr">open-source</a> project that is about sharing genetical and phenotypic information. The idea to this project came to Bastian after he was genotyped by 23andMe in May 2011 and started playing around with his data. During his research he became frustrated, because it was not that easy to find mode data. He started working on openSNP to fix this. To be clear: This project is not about making money, selling data or to quote Google: “We don’t wanna be evil”. We are just interested in making science more open and accessible.

              This heavily depends on how many other users are in the queue, waiting for their data to be parsed. Right now openSNP runs on a small scale server so it may take 2-3 days until all your variations can be found on the site. But you can start using openSNP right away and others can download your raw-data right from the start. The parsing only affects the "other users sharing this SNP" and the "my genotype"-views.

             <em><a href="https://www.23andme.com/exome/">23andMe</a></em> has a limited exome sequencing offer. If you've got your exome sequenced through <em>23andMe</em> you can now upload the VCF (Variant Call Format, see <a href="#filetypes"> the filetypes-FAQ</a>) version of your exome as well. But there are some limitations: While users will be able to download your complete VCF-file we currently don't have the computing power to parse all of your variation. So currently we will only parse the already known SNPs out of your file. For the same reasons we currently can't offer uploads of the raw sequence data. <br/><br/>The feature is still in an early beta stage, so please notify us if something goes wrong.

	          <strong>1.</strong>You should read the description on the phenotype you are about to enter. Often the description gives further details on which kind of answers people are interested in. You can also take a look on the answers which are given so far by other users. This should also give you a feeling about what kind of information is wanted for this phenotype. <br/><strong>2.</strong> As soon as you start to enter your own variation we will try to auto-complete your writing to avoid duplicate entries into the openSNP-database. Having multiple entries for the same thing, like "blue-green" plus "green-blue" in case of eye-colour makes it harder for (citizen) scientists to use the data for their studies. <br/><strong>3.</strong> The thing you are about to enter doesn't get auto-completed?

As soon as you start writing your characteristics name openSNP will try to auto-complete what you are writing. This should reduce duplicate phenotypes, so if you are about to enter "eye-colour" you will get a suggestions for the already available "eye-color" (Sorry, we can't solve the AE / BE issue here).<br/><strong>3.</strong> Write a description about the characteristic you are interested in. Give users some words why this is interesting. Maybe add what research has been done so far on this phenotype. Links to further web-resources and/or Wikipedia might also be a good idea. If you already have suggestions which different answers might apply to this phenotype: List them in the description. <br/><strong>4.</strong> Enter your own variation: The last field, "variation" is meant to carry your own variation for this phenotype. Don't enter all possible answers (You can list those in the description). Other users can easily add their own variation and take your suggestions from the description or - if you forgot to list a possible answer - give completely new answers.

            If you connect your <em>Fitbit</em> account with <em>openSNP</em> we will save data for up to three different categories: Activities, Body and Sleep. In the activity category we will save your step-count and the number of floors you've climbed for each day. For the body category we will save your Body Mass Index and your weight for each day. In the sleep category we will save how many minutes you have slept, how many minutes you were awake while you tried to sleep, how long it took you to fall asleep and the number of times you awoke for each night.<br/><br/>If you connect your <em>Fitbit</em> account we will also save as much data of past days as it's possible to get through the API of <em>Fitbit</em>.

            Yes, you can choose which for which categories we should save the data. For example you can share our activity-data, so people can see the number of steps you have taken for each day, along with the floors you have climbed, but keep your body and sleep data on <em>FitBit</em>.Two things you should keep in mind: You can (de)activate the saving of data for different categories at any time. <br/><br/>1. If you deactivate a category we will delete all of your data of this category from <em>openSNP</em> (but of course not on <em>Fitbit</em>).<br/>2.

            No, if you connect your <em>Fitbit</em> account with <em>openSNP</em> we only have read-access. The read-access gives us access to all data you have in your <em>Fitbit</em> account, but we will only read and save the data for which you have given us permission. We're sorry that you have to trust us in this point but the <em>Fitbit</em> API currently doesn't allow for a more granular setting.

            Yes, once your <em>Fitbit</em> account is connected and set up we will get an notification from <em>Fitbit</em> each time you enter or change any data in their system. So each time your tracker uploads new data to <em>Fitbit</em> we will get those changes as well. This also works for past records. So if you change or delete entries on the <em>Fitbit</em> website those changes will be reflected on <em>openSNP</em> as well.

	<legend>My filetype is still missing, what can I do?</legend>
	We are always interested in adding more data. If your company is missing up to now it is, because we did not have an example-file to optimize our parser on it. But if you contact us at <%=link_to "parsing@opensnp.org","mailto:parsing@opensnp.org"%> and send us your file we can fix this, so that all customers of the DTC company of your choice can participate.

<h4>Using DAS</h4>
<legend>DAS?</legend>
We've implemented some basic commands of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Annotation_System"><em>Distributed Annotation System</em></a> (DAS). Those are for example used for the genome browsers on the SNP-pages in <em>openSNP</em>. 

<legend>Where can I learn more about DAS?</legend>
If you want to learn more about the use at <em>openSNP</em> you can <a href="http://opensnp.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/videos-on-opensnp-das-support/">watch this video</a> which explains a bit about it. You can also read the <a href="http://www.biodas.org/documents/spec.html">specifications</a> or read about <a href="http://www.dasregistry.org/DASCommandExamples.jsp">example commands</a> at the <a href="http://www.dasregistry.org/"><em>DASRegistry</em></a>. 

<legend>How can I see all DAS sources?</legend>
To find all DAS-sources you can point your browser to <a href="http://opensnp.org/das/sources"><em>http://opensnp.org/das/sources</em></a>. You should get back some XML which roughly looks like this: 
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  &lt;SOURCES&gt;
    &lt;SOURCE uri=&quot;6&quot; title=&quot;6&quot; description=&quot;6&quot;&gt;
      &lt;MAINTAINER email=&quot;admin@opensnp.org&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;VERSION created=&quot;29.09.2011 15:43&quot; uri=&quot;6&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/SOURCE&gt;
      &lt;SOURCE uri=&quot;10&quot; title=&quot;10&quot; description=&quot;10&quot;&gt;
      &lt;MAINTAINER email=&quot;admin@opensnp.org&quot;/&gt;

      &lt;CAPABILITY type=&quot;das1:unknown-segment&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/VERSION&gt;
    &lt;/SOURCE&gt;
  &lt;/SOURCES&gt;
</pre>
The title of each source corresponds to a single <em>openSNP</em>-user. Even if users have provided more than one file you can query all the data available for this user through a single DAS-source. 

<legend>How can I query a DAS source?</legend>
To query a DAS-source you can use the <em>features</em>-command and provide the chromosome and slice you are interested in. For example <a href="http://opensnp.org/das/1/features?segment=1:1,1000000"><em>http://opensnp.org/das/1/features?segment=1:1,1000000</em></a> will provide you with all SNPs which are located between base 1 and 1000000 for the user with the ID #1. It will produce a similar XML-output like shown below: 

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  &lt;DASGFF&gt;

The general URL-schema for DAS-feature-requests is http://opensnp.org/das/$USER_ID/features?segment=$CHROMOSOME:$START_BASE,$STOP_BASE.  
</div>
  
<div id="api">
	<legend>Using JSON</legend>
	We provide some methods to make it easier to get data back from <em>openSNP</em>. Currently we are implementing some <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JavaScript Object Notation</a></i> (short: JSON) methods that will make it easier to code some awesome <em>openSNP</em>-utilizing stuff. As you can see on the Wikipedia-page there are many JSON-parsers around for all major programming languages and it is fairly human readable as well. Plus: It is one of the de facto webstandards for APIs. We are trying to add more of such methods in the near future. 
	<legend>Getting a list of openSNP-users</legend>
	You can easily access a complete list of all users, with their unique user-ids and links to their genotyping-files, by accessing <a href="http://opensnp.org/users.json">http://opensnp.org/users.json</a>, similarly to the "normal" users-index-page. You will get back an array which includes all the data in a structured way which looks like this.<br/><br/>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
[{"name":"Bastian Greshake","id":1,"genotypes":[{"id":9,"filetype":"23andme","download_url":"http://opensnp.org/data/1.23andme.9"}]},{"name":"Little bit","id":14,"genotypes":[{"id":6,"filetype":"23andme","download_url":"http://opensnp.org/data/14.23andme.6"}]},{"name":"Svan","id":10,"genotypes":[{"id":3,"filetype":"23andme","download_url":"http://opensnp.org/data/10.23andme.3"}]},{"name":"Helge Rausch","id":15,"genotypes":[]}]
		</pre>
		
	<legend>Getting genotypes of one or multiple users for a given SNP-name</legend>
	To get back an JSON object that includes information about the SNP as well as the genotype of one or many users at this SNP you can use this JSON request: <a href="http://opensnp.org/snps/json/rs9939609/1,2,8.json">http://opensnp.org/snps/json/$snpname/$userid.json</a>. Just replace $snpname by a real Rs-ID and $userid by the ID of the user(s) you are interested in. If you use a single user-id you will get back a single object that looks like this:<br/><br/>
	<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{"snp":{"name":"rs9939609","chromosome":"16","position":"52378028"},"user":{"name":"Bastian Greshake","id":1,"genotypes":[{"genotype_id":9,"local_genotype":"AT"}]}}
</pre> 
If you want to get the data of multiple users you can use commas to separate the user-ids (like <a href="http://opensnp.org/snps/json/rs9939609/1,6,8.json">http://opensnp.org/snps/json/rs9939609/1,6,8.json</a>) or a dash to specify a range of users you are interested in (so <a href="http://opensnp.org/snps/json/rs9939609/1-8.json">http://opensnp.org/snps/json/rs9939609/1-8.json</a> will give you the genotypes of users one to eight.) You will get back an array that includes all the items that you requested and which looks like this: <br/><br/>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
[{"snp":{"name":"rs9939609","chromosome":"16","position":"52378028"},"user":{"name":"Bastian Greshake","id":1,"genotypes":[{"genotype_id":9,"local_genotype":"AT"}]}},{"snp":{"name":"rs9939609","chromosome":"16","position":"52378028"},"user":{"name":"Nash Parovoz","id":6,"genotypes":[{"genotype_id":5,"local_genotype":"AT"}]}},{"snp":{"name":"rs9939609","chromosome":"16","position":"52378028"},"user":{"name":"Samantha","id":8,"genotypes":[{"genotype_id":2,"local_genotype":"TT"}]}}]
</pre>
The results include the genotype and user ids, so it should be easy to trace data back to it's source if you want to.
	<legend>Getting all phenotypes of one or many different users</legend>
	Similar to the genotypes you can request a complete list of all phenotypic information that has been entered by a single user, just use <a href="http://opensnp.org/phenotypes/json/1.json">http://opensnp.org/phenotypes/json/$userid.json</a> and replace $userid by the ID of the user you are interested in. Just as for the genotype-JSON you can ask us for the data of multiple users by using a comma-separated list (<a href="http://opensnp.org/phenotypes/json/1,6,8.json">http://opensnp.org/phenotypes/json/1,6,8.json</a>) or a dash to supply the method with a range of IDs (<a href="http://opensnp.org/phenotypes/json/1-8.json">http://opensnp.org/phenotypes/json/1-8.json</a>). The resulting output will look like this: <br/><br/>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
{"user":{"name":"D G","id":11},"phenotypes":{"white skin":{"phenotype_id":4,"variation":"tan skin"},"Handedness":{"phenotype_id":3,"variation":"right-handed"},"Lactose intolerance":{"phenotype_id":2,"variation":"lactose-tolerant"},"Eye color":{"phenotype_id":1,"variation":"brown"}}}
</pre>
	<legend>The method I need is missing and/or I need more help!?</legend>
	There are many ways in which this problem can be fixed. First of all: If you are able to code some <em>Rails</em> and have got some basic understanding of <em>JSON</em> feel invited to help us with the development of <em>openSNP</em>. The source code is freely available at <a href="https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/snpr">GitHub</a> and we are always looking for some motivated people who want to join us. Just start coding the stuff you are interested in and make a pull request. Or what about <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/snpr-development">joining the openSNP development mailinglist/Google group and you can get to know us a bit better?</a> <br/>But don't worry if you don't feel like spending that much time with us (letting alone having that much time left): We are working on implementing more of this stuff, so if you've got a great idea that we should absolutely include just let us know: Write us at <a href="mailto:info@opensnp.org">info@opensnp.org</a> or drop <a href="http://opensnp.org/messages/new?user_to_send=23">Philipp</a> or <a href="http://opensnp.org/messages/new?user_to_send=1">Basti</a> a note. And the same is true if you need some more support with those methods already in place.
