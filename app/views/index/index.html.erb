						<h4>Upload Your Genotyping File</h4>
						<%=image_tag("fileupload.png")%><br/>
                        Upload your raw genotyping or exome data from <em><%=link_to "23andMe","http://www.23andme.com"%></em>, <em><%=link_to "deCODEme","http://www.decodeme.com/"%></em> or <em><%= link_to "FamilyTreeDNA", "http://www.familytreedna.com/" %></em> to the <em>openSNP</em> database to make it available for everybody.

					<h4>Share Your Phenotypes & Traits</h4> 
					<%=image_tag("phenotypes.png")%><br/>
                    Phenotypes are the observable characteristics of your body, such as height, eye color or preference for coffee.
					Share your phenotype with other <em>openSNP</em> users, and find others with similar characteristics and traits.<br/>Your data may help scientists discover new genetic associations!
					</div>
					<div class="well span3">
					<h4>Share your stories on variations & phenotypes</h4>
					<%=image_tag("sendmessage.png")%></br>
					With <em>openSNP</em> you can share stories about your genetic variations and phenotypes, and discover the stories of other users. 
					</div>
					<div class="well span3">
					<h4>Find literature on genetic variation</h4>
					<%=image_tag("literature.png")%></br>
					<em>openSNP</em> gets the latest open access journal articles on genetic variations from the <em><%=link_to "Public Library of Science","http://www.plos.org/"%></em>. Popular articles are indexed via the social reference manager <em><%=link_to "Mendeley","http://www.mendeley.com/"%></em>, and summaries are provided by <em><%=link_to "SNPedia","http://snpedia.com"%></em>.

					<h4>Search for phenotypes</h4>
					<%=image_tag("phenotypesearch.png")%><br/>
					Many diseases and traits are suspected to have genetical components. Genome Wide Association Studies are a simple tool for finding genetic markers. Easily find people with the variation you are interested in via <em>openSNP</em>.<br/><br/>Is the variation for which you're looking not entered yet? Just add it to <em>openSNP</em>.

					<div class="well span4">
					<h4>Easily download datasets</h4>
					<%=image_tag("filedownload.png")%><br/>
                    The mass-download function of <em>openSNP</em> allows you to easily download full genotyping raw-data in the file formats that are provided by <em>23andMe</em>, <em>deCODEme</em> and <em>FamilyTreeDNA</em>.<br/><br/>As the files can be grouped by their variations for specific phenotypes, it's easy to get datasets that are already usable for association studies. 
					</div>
					<div class="well span4">
					<h4>Get notified about new data</h4>
					<%=image_tag("rss.png")%><br/>
					<em>openSNP</em> delivers an RSS feed for each phenotype. So you can easily get all new datasets that get available for the phenotypes of your interest, without the need to check for new entries by hand.<br/><br/>For data-junkies that need more data: there's also a feed that carries all new datasets.
