<p class="lead"><em><a href="http://www.fitbit.com">Fitbit</a></em> is a wearable gadget which allows you to track your activities (How many steps have you taken? How many floors have you climbed?), your sleep (How long did you sleep? How often have you awoken at night?) and also allows you to track your body-development (i.e. your weight/BMI). The data collected by and through your <em>Fitbit</em> is a valuable extension of the phenotypes you've already entered in openSNP.</p>

<p class="lead">Once you've connected your <em>Fitbit</em> account to openSNP we will automatically get your latest data from FitBit. Each time you synchronize your <em>Fitbit</em>-tracker or enter new data on <em>Fitbit</em> the changes will also appear on openSNP. Currently we save data about your activities, your body and your sleep.</p>

<p class="lead">The data will be public on the openSNP-website, like all other phenotypes. However, you can decide which categories you will connect with openSNP and which not.</p>
