now that the holiday stress recedes slowly, we, the openSNP team, wish you a Happy New Year (if you happen to follow the Gregorian calendar). We hope you made it safely through your holidays and 2016 in general.

We did have some news in 2016. First of all, we managed to break the barrier of 3000 uploaded data sets! At the time of writing we're having 3090 genotyping files in our database. Thanks so much to each of you who contributed their part to this. With the rising number of data came also some new challenges in maintaining the project. Thanks to our three Google Summer of Code students, we could work on some of them, improving the overall code base of openSNP and making things hopefully run more smoothly for all of us.
Bastian gave a brief (and pretty jet-lagged) talk about the state of openSNP at last year's Bioinformatics Open Source Conference. You can see the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsoDPk-wVVE

Not only the amount of data did grow, but interest in using the data is growing as well, as seen from the citations of the publication describing openSNP ( https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oe=utf-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=265199174584278190 ). And the next studies are already on their way! There's still a chance for you to submit your height for the machine learning challenge run by https://www.crowdai.org/ at the EPFL, Switzerland, which aims to find associations between a person's height and their genome. Just answer this single question here to help with that: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOG0tZUaw1gD6MaFetjqyM6_jpwEgL74DnY15l9-hSZTalbA/viewform?entry.28571329=<%=@user.id%>

Additionally, the University of Kassel, Germany, will be running a survey on the motivations behind sharing your genome. You can find more information about that below or at https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb07/institute/ibwl/personen-fachgebiete/sunyaev-prof-dr/research/gendar

And last but not least: We now have some financial stability with which we're operating these days. Thanks to our Patreon page that launched at the end of 2015 we are now nearly community-financed. Right now it costs us around USD 100 per month to pay for the hosting, domains, etc. We used to pay out of our own pocket, but now about 95% of this money comes from you, and we are so thankful for that. If you want to chip in a dollar per month you can do so at https://www.patreon.com/openSNP - and if we exceed the USD 150 threshold we will be able to update our technical infrastructure even further!

Thank you for your continuing support, and looking forward to breaking more barriers!
