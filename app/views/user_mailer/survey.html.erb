    Dear <%=@user.name%>,
    <p>
      Today we’d like to reach out to you with two topics that might interest you:
    </p>
    <p>
      The first is a survey about your motivations, fears and experiences about participating in openSNP, which we did along with researchers from the University of Zurich, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177158">was finally published in PLOS ONE</a>. If you want to dive into the survey data itself you’ll find all you need there as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      The second thing we want to highlight is what Open Humans is doing. They are a non-profit community that enables sharing your data sets and connecting you with researchers and citizen scientists. Currently there are two projects about genetic data interpretation and visualization that might be of interest to you. <i>Open Humans</i> Co-founder Madeleine Ball wrote a brief introduction about the platform itself and the projects that might be of interest to you. You can find it below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until next time,
    </p>
    <p>
      Philipp and Bastian, for the openSNP-team
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear openSNP member,
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd like to invite you to become a member of Open Humans, and highlight two projects in <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/">Open Humans</a> that may be of particular interest or value to openSNP members.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Humans is a nonprofit platform and community that gives you an ongoing profile for connecting and sharing your genetic and other data. We also make it easy for researchers and citizen scientists to create projects that others can join – enabling you to explore data and contribute to research in new ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two projects in Open Humans you might be interested in, as they specifically invite individuals publicly sharing their genetic data:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/genomix-genome-exploration/">GenomiX Genome Exploration</a>: Interested in genome data visualization? If you're already someone publicly sharing your 23andMe data, there's a research team that would love to work with you. A team led by Orit Shaer (Wellesley) and Oded Nov (NYU) have developed a genetic data exploration tool. Join their project and they'll invite you to participate in an online study this Spring/Summer that uses your own genetic data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/genevieve-genome-report/">Genevieve Genome Report</a>: Genevieve is a tool that matches your data against ClinVar, a public database that aggregates information about genetic variants. To help improve shared understanding, Genevieve also invites users to contribute to shared, public, wiki-style notes. Because Genevieve uses a different matching algorithm, it has the potential to discover new information not available in your OpenSNP report.
    </p>
    <p>
      More about Open Humans: Launched in 2015, Open Humans is a program of the US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit Open Humans Foundation (formerly called PersonalGenomes.org). Although it is not a study in itself, Open Humans allows you to join studies from a variety of academic institutions. In addition, members that join the optional Public Data Sharing study are able to publicly share data on the site, which is necessary for the two projects highlighted here. You can contact Open Humans for more information by emailing support@openhumans.org.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>

      You're receiving this email as your openSNP-settings say that you're okay with getting some emails from the openSNP-team. You can change this setting really easy at https://opensnp.org/users/<%=@user.id%>/edit#notifications</br></br>
