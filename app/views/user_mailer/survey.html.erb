<p>
  the middle of the year is nearing and we have some more news that might be of interest for the broader openSNP community.
</p>
<p>
  On June 1st/2nd Mozilla held its yearly “Global Sprint”, where people all around the world come together, in person or virtually, to spend two days working on all kinds of open source/science/education related topics. <a href="http://ruleofthirds.de/participation-mozsprint/">Philipp and Bastian participated</a> and were joined by three new contributors to openSNP. Thanks for joining us <a href="https://github.com/amiefairs">Amie</a>, <a href="https://github.com/andreabedini">Andrea</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bverpaalen">Brent</a>! The biggest new thing that we achieved is giving openSNP the much needed face-lift, something that our Google Summer of Code student Mateus had spent much time working on already in the last summer. With this openSNP finally has a design that should work nicely on your smartphones and tablets as well. Check it out on <a href="https://opensnp.org">openSNP.org</a>. And please be in touch with us if you find any things that don’t work like they should.
  And if you can’t hear enough about us: The people of ColperScience started a new podcast during the Global Sprint, and <a href="http://blog.colperscience.com/2017/06/15/building-an-open-source-platform-for-crowdsourced-open-data-sharing/">Bastian joined them to talk about openSNP</a>.

  The second topic we wanted to share with you is less light, but it is a topic that is close to our heart at openSNP, as it concerns the free sharing of information and knowledge: Diego Gómez, a conservation biologist from Colombia, who is being sued for sharing another researcher’s Master thesis on the web. Diego originally got access to it through a closed Facebook group and made it publicly available to help others studying the biology of amphibians in his hometown university. In 2014 and under Colombia’s strict copyright laws, the author pressed criminal charges against Diego, where a conviction would mean 4-8 years in prison in addition to a fine. This May, <a href="https://www.karisma.org.co/compartirnoesdelito/diego-gomez-found-innocent/">Diego was acquitted of all charges in the first instance</a>, by proving that the document was already available online, and having neither the intention to gain financial benefit from it nor to harm the author.
</p>
<p>
  This could be the end of the story, but the ruling has been appealed and Diego will now have to defend himself in a higher court. To help paying his legal defense, <a href="https://www.generosity.com/education-fundraising/compartir-no-es-delito-sharing-is-not-a-crime/x/1756182 ">the Fundación Karisma, who has been advising Diego from the start, has started a crowdfunding campaign</a>. No one should face years in prison for sharing scientific knowledge. This is why we have already personally contributed to Diego’s defense fund and want to encourage you to spread the word about the campaign (and <a href="https://www.generosity.com/education-fundraising/compartir-no-es-delito-sharing-is-not-a-crime/x/1756182">contribute if you can afford it</a>).
