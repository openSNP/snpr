  The last few months have been a bit more quiet for openSNP. This is partially due some changes in Bastian’s personal life: He submitted his PhD thesis in September and has just moved to the United States to start his new job as the Director of Research for Open Humans. <a href="http://ruleofthirds.de/joining-open-humans/">Read more about this on Bastian’s blog</a>. And with these changes out of the way we do have two updates to share with you:

  <b>Results of the CrowdAI openSNP Challenge</b>
</p>
<p>
  The machine learning challenge that we ran together with CrowdAI at the EPFL, Switzerland has come to an end. A total of 132 participants made 751 submissions on how to predict a person’s height from their genotyping data. The best predictions were made by David Baranger, who has <a href="https://medium.com/@dbaranger/on-predicting-traits-with-genetics-b5967cba949">written a great blog post about his contributions</a>. His secret: He did not use any machine learning!</br>
  As the winner of the competition David will be invited to present his work at the Applied Machine Learning Days in Geneva in January 2018! If you want to meet David: <a href="https://www.appliedmldays.org/#news ">Sign up to hear when tickets to the event are on sale</a>.

  <b>Using genetic raw data</b>
</p>
<p>
  Sarah Nelson is a long-time friend of openSNP. She is a doctoral student at the University of Washington in Seattle and does research on how people use their genetic raw data. Given that you are already putting your own data to use on openSNP this might be of interest. Sarah has written a couple of lines about her work and how to get to know her better below:
</p>
<p>
  Dear openSNP users,</br>
  I am a doctoral student at the University of Washington conducting a research study on consumer genetic testing, and in particular how people use their "raw"/uninterpreted genetic data --- including on platforms such as openSNP. Please consider <a href="https://redcap.iths.org/surveys/?s=84NKNFYXJC&loop=6">taking my online survey if you have done a direct-to-consumer genetic test and are 18 or over</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The survey takes, on average, 15 minutes or less to complete. Responses are anonymous, unless you volunteer at the end to provide contact info for potential follow-up interviewing. The survey will stay open through November 27th.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to contact me directly with questions or concerns (sarahcn@uw.edu), and to read more about me and my research interests on my website, http://myopenreadingframe.com.

<p>
  Many thanks for considering,</br>
  Sarah
