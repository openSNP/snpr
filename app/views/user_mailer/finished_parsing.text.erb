Hello <%= @user.name %>,

I just finished parsing your <%= @vendor %> file. I found a total of
<%= @stats[:rows_without_comments] %> rows (exclusive comments) in it and was
able to import <%= @stats[:rows_after_parsing] %> SNPs.

If this seems way off, feel free to contact us!

Cheers,
the openSNP Parser
