    <p>
      You have recently uploaded a genotyping to our repository, but it
      looks like it contains email addresses. Some users have uploaded files
      with email addresses of strangers in the past, which we obviously cannot allow.
      Therefore, we have deleted your genotyping. The easiest way to fix this is to
      find out why your file contains email addresses, to remove these, and to re-upload it.
