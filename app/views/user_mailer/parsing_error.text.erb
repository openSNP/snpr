We are sorry to inform you that there was at least one line in your genotyping
file, excluding the header, that could not be parsed correctly.
This may be a minor problem or not. If you can't see your local genotypes for
the SNPs or you encounter any other problems, you could try deleting your
genotyping file at <%=edit_user_url(@user)%>.

Afterwards, you can re-upload your genotyping file.

If this bug persists and you're sure that you set the correct filetype and the
file is valid, please let us know.

It's possible your DTC company changed the file-format they use.

If you need some help, you can read the FAQ <%=faq_url()%> or email us at info@opensnp.org.
