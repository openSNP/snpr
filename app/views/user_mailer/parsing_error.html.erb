    <b>Hi <%=@user.name%>,</b>
    <p>
      We are sorry to inform you that there was at least one line in your genotyping file, excluding the header, that could not be parsed correctly. This may be a minor problem or not. If you can't see your local genotypes for the SNPs or you encounter any other problems, you could try deleting your genotyping file at <%=edit_user_url(@user)%>. Afterwards, you can re-upload your genotyping file.

      If this bug persists and you're sure that you set the correct filetype and the file is valid, please let us know. It's possible your DTC company changed the file-format they use.

    </p>
    <p>
      If you need help, <a href="<%=faq_url()%>">you can read the FAQ</a> or contact us by replying to this mail.

      Cheers,
      the openSNP team
