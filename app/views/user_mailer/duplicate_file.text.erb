You have recently uploaded a genotyping to our repository,
but it looks like we have stored the same file already!

There was most-likely a mistake while uploading, leading to the same file being
processed twice. In that case, you can ignore this mail as the first genotyping
remains on the server.

If there is no genotyping listed in your user-account, please contact us!

If you need help, you can read the FAQ <%=faq_url()%> or email us at info@opensnp.org.
