Hello <%=@user.name%>,

You have recently uploaded a genotyping to our repository, but it looks like we have stored the same file already!

Most probably there was a mistake while uploading leading to the same file being processed twice. In that case, you can ignore this mail as the first genotyping remains on the server.

If there is no genotyping listed in your user-account, please contact us!

If you need help you can read the FAQ <%=faq_url()%> or contact us by replying to this mail.

Cheers,
your openSNP-team.
