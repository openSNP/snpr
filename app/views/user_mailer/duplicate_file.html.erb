    <b>Hi <%=@user.name%>,</b>
    <p>
      You have recently uploaded a genotyping to our repository, but it looks
      like we have stored the same file already!</br>
      There was most-likely a mistake while uploading, leading to the same
      file being processed twice. In that case, you can ignore this mail as
      the first genotyping remains on the server.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is no genotyping listed in your user-account, please contact us!</br>
      If you need help, <a href="<%=faq_url()%>">you can read the FAQ</a> or email us at info@opensnp.org.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheers,
      the openSNP team
