    <p>
      You have recently uploaded a genotyping to our repository, but it looks
      like we have stored the same file already!</br>
      There was most-likely a mistake while uploading, leading to the same
      file being processed twice. In that case, you can ignore this mail as
      the first genotyping remains on the server.
