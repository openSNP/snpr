Hello! [openSNP.org](https://opensnp.org) is a repository to which users can upload their SNP-sets (and exome-VCFs) from
23andme, deCODEme, FamilyTreeDNA, AncestryDNA and IYG-format (for participants
of EBI genotyping). On upload, SNPs are annotated using the PLoS and
Mendeley-APIs to show users the newest scientific research results on their
SNPs. Each SNP is also linked to the relevant page on SNPedia. SNPs are ranked
according to how many results could be gathered for SNPedia, PLoS and Mendeley
(in that order). Users can send each other private messages as well as comment
on SNPs and Phenotypes.
